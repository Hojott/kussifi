      I am Kussi "Sakari" Marttinen and I don't like frontend. I did however create this veri great website for you to enjoy,
      as I got tired of seeing a 404 when I tried going to my website. It was created with Vite so I had to put veri low effort
      and it doesn't even have any vulnerabilities! (100% cybersecure!) </p>
